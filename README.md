Automatically redirects MSN news articles to their original source.

Please note that it may not redirect certain articles, but it will redirect almost all of those you visit.

This is because some articles do not contain the original source.

## Why did you create this?
I use DuckDuckGo. It still queries Bing under the hood, which often serves news links via MSN.

Because I hate MSN, I have created this.
